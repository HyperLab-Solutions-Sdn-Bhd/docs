# Getting Started

Setting up Dialex is simple and straightforward. We prepared several SDKs for popular languages and frameworks.

### Node

```
$ npm install --save dialex
```

Other languages coming soon!

### Misc

It is advisable to use one of our provided SDKs for development. Even so, we made the API accessible using HTTP requests.

```
GET /api/v1/
```
